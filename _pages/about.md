I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at the CUNY Graduate Center and an incoming Assistant Professor at the Department of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I am a social demographer studying the creation, persistence, and reproduction of inequality, poverty, and mobility, with substantive interests in wealth and its intersection with welfare state policy. My research encompasses the quantitative analysis of survey data, administrative records, and experimental data. My current work focuses on multiple facets of wealth inequality and accumulation, with a particular focus on the impact of inheritances and inheritance taxes. I received my Ph.D. from Humboldt-University Berlin in 2022.
