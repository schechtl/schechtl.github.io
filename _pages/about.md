I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at the CUNY Graduate Center.

I am a sociologist with research interests in the policy determinants of poverty and of income and wealth inequality. My research is centered around different dimensions of tax policy and their consequences. My recent work is concerned with comparative fiscal impoverishment, i.e., the fraction of people who are taxed into poverty across rich countries. One focus of my research on economic inequality concerns differential tax treatment across family types. My current work focuses on multiple facets of wealth inequality and accumulation, with a particular focus on the impact of inheritance taxes. I received my Ph.D. from Humboldt-University Berlin in 2022.
