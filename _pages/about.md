Manuel Schechtl is a research associate at the Department of Social Sciences at Humboldt-University Berlin.

He is a sociologist with research interests in the policy determinants of poverty and of income and wealth inequality. His research is centered around different dimensions of tax policy and their consequences. Schechtlâ€™s recent work is concerned with comparative fiscal impoverishment, i.e., the fraction of people who are taxed into poverty across rich countries. One focus of his research on economic inequality concerns differential tax treatment across family types. His current work focuses on multiple facets of wealth inequality and accumulation, with a particular focus on the impact of inheritance taxes. He is expected to receive his Ph.D. from Humboldt-University Berlin in July 2022.
