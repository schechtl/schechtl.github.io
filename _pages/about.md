I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I am a social demographer studying the creation, persistence, and reproduction of inequality, poverty, and mobility, with substantive interests in wealth and its intersection with public policy. My research encompasses the quantitative analysis of survey data, administrative records, and experimental data. My current work focuses on multiple facets of wealth inequality and accumulation, with a particular focus on the impact of inheritances and inheritance taxes. 

Before joining the faculty at UNC, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at the CUNY Graduate Center. I hold bachelor’s degrees in Political Science and Economics and a master’s degree in Sociology. I received my Ph.D. in Sociology from Humboldt University Berlin.
