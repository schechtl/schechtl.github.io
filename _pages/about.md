I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at the CUNY Graduate Center and a Visiting Research Affiliate at the Center for Empirical Research on Stratification and Inequality (CERSI) at Yale University.

I am a social scientist with research interests in the social consequences and policy determinants of poverty and of income and wealth inequality. My current work focuses on multiple facets of wealth inequality and accumulation, with a particular focus on the impact of inheritances and inheritance taxes. I received my Ph.D. from Humboldt-University Berlin in 2022.
